> Common middleware for applications built with base-methods (like assemble, verb, generate, and update)

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install --save common-middleware
```

## Usage

```js
var middleware = require('common-middleware');
var assemble = require('assemble-core');

// create your app
var app = assemble();

// register the middleware
app.use(middleware());
```

## Middleware

The following middleware are included.

### [front matter](index.js#L48)

Parses front-matter on files that match `options.extRegex` and
adds the resulting data object to `file.data`. This object is
passed as context to the template engine at render time.

### [unescape templates](index.js#L65)

Registers a `.preWrite` middleware for unescaping escaped delimiters.

### [escape templates](index.js#L135)

Uses C-style macros to escape templates with `{%%= foo %}` or
`<%= foo %>` syntax, so they will not be evaluated by a template
engine when `.render` is called.

### [JSON on-load](index.js#L181)

Adds a `json` property to the `file` object when the file extension
matches `options.jsonRegex`. This allows JSON files to be updated
by other middleware or pipeline plugins without having to parse and
stringify with each modification.

### [JSON pre-write](index.js#L214)

If `file.contents` has not already been updated directly, the `file.contents` property
is updated with stringified JSON before writing the file back to the file
system.

## Options

### options.jsonRegex

Customize the regex used for matching JSON files.

**Example**

```js
app.use(middleware({jsonRegex: /\.json$/}));
```

### options.extRegex

Customize the regex used for matching template file extensions.

**Example**

```js
app.use(middleware({jsonRegex: /\.(hbs|tmpl)$/}));
```

### options.escapeRegex

Customize the regex used for matching the extensions of files with templates to escape.

**Example**

```js
app.use(middleware({jsonRegex: /\.(tmpl|hbs)$/}));
```
